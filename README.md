# Code Insights

## Introduction

This tool will couple to your GitLab repository and provide you with a dashboard of information about your codebase.
It will provide you with information about the following:

- Amount of commits
- Amount of issues
- Amount of merge requests
- Amount of lines of code

At first only GitLab is supported, but in the future more providers will be added.

Based on those settings the rankings and statistics will be generated.

You can see all of the above like:

- Who has the most commits
- Who created the most issues (Tickets)
- Who created the most merge requests
- Who reviewed the most merge requests
- Who has the most lines of code
